== HTML5 Validator Docker Setup ==

1. Start the [Nu HTML Validator Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/validator/validator/) container with the following command, replacing `<pathToFilesYouWantToValidate>` with the path to all the project folders:

```bash

docker run -it --rm -v <pathToFilesYouWantToValidate>:/portfolios validator/validator:latest

```

2. Get access to the validator CLI inside the container by running:

```bash
# Run the following first to get the name of the running container
docker ps

# Run the following command to get into the container
docker exec -it <nameOfContainer> /bin/bash
```

3. Once inside the container, run the validator and direct the output to a log file using the following:

```bash
vnu --skip-non-html --also-check-css /portfolios  - 2>&1 | tee /portfolios/errors.log
```
